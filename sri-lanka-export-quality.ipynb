    "Overall, Sri Lanka seems to be experiencing significant progress on its national-level quality of exports, which is also the case of Sri Lanka’s textile-related exports. In general, textile-related exports are very well positioned in terms of quality in comparison to the rest of its exports. Internationally, garment products are positioned on the mid-range distribution in terms of quality, whereas other products from fabrics and fibres are on the lower range of the international distribution of quality. Nevertheless, most products under study evinced positive evolutions in their levels of quality.\n",
